# svg-to-gd
Port any SVG image to Geometry Dash

## Made by
Jaan#2897(mostly) and some code by camila314(converting svg to objects)
Feel free to contact me

## How to run
1. Install Python 3.7+
2. Download this repo
3. Run `python main.py`
4. Input some values
5. Done :)

## How it works
It basically just uses gd.py to add objects/create a level with them and svgpathtools to actually make those objects.

## Special thanks
 * nekit for gd.py
 * [camila314 for being a huge timesaver](https://github.com/camila314/GraphicsGD2)
 * all the gdp community =)
